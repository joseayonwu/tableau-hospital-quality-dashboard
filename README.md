# 🏥 Hospital Quality Intelligence Dashboard  
*Interactive Tableau project analyzing U.S. hospital performance*

---

## 🎯 Objective
This project delivers an executive-ready Tableau dashboard that analyzes hospital quality metrics across the United States.  
It applies advanced visualization techniques — **data blending, LOD expressions, forecasting, and parameter-driven sensitivity analysis** — to explore how **ownership, staffing, and geography** affect healthcare outcomes.

---

## 🧠 Data Preparation
The dataset is based on the **CMS Hospital General Information** database, complemented with two synthetic variables:
- **Staff-to-Patient Ratio**
- **Average Readmission Cost per Provider ID**

Data was cleaned and transformed in **Tableau Prep**:
- Removed non-analytic fields and standardized data types  
- Mapped text ratings into numeric scales (Overall 1–5; Quality 1–3)  
- Corrected Latitude/Longitude for mapping  
- Joined and exported as a single `.hyper` extract powering all dashboards  

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Voluntary (non-profit)** hospitals lead overall quality metrics.  
- **Private (for-profit)** hospitals perform strongly in Safety & Timeliness but underperform in Readmission.  
- **Government** hospitals align near the national average, with Mortality below benchmark.  
- **Geography** alone does not explain quality differences — operational management matters more.  
- **Staff-to-patient ratio** shows limited predictive power; process design and efficiency matter more than staffing quantity.

## ⚙️ Dashboard Features
- KPI panel comparing **State vs National averages**
- Ownership performance benchmarking  
- Trend analysis of **Staff Ratio → Quality metrics**  
- Parameter-based **Sensitivity (What-If) Simulator**  
- Clean storytelling structure: *Hospital Quality → Ownership → Trends → Sensitivity*
